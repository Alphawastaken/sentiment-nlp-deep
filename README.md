# sentiment-nlp-deep
---
This project applies deep learning techniques to sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Using a custom preprocessing pipeline and Word2Vec embeddings, multiple neural architectures (CNNs, RNNs, and hybrid models) are built and trained in PyTorch. Evaluation includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with attention to overfitting and reproducibility. This work extends the traditional baseline by leveraging modern deep learning for NLP.

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This repository contains the **Ergasia2_TEDE** notebook, developed for the *Artificial Intelligence II: Deep Learning for NLP* course.  
It implements **deep learning models for sentiment classification** on Twitter data.  

Key features:
- Preprocessing pipeline tailored for tweets  
- Word embeddings (**Word2Vec**, pretrained vectors)  
- Deep learning architectures (CNN, RNN, etc.) with PyTorch  
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
